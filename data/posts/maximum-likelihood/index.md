## Introduction
Supposed we have a dataset $ \bm{D = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_N)}$ of $\bm{N}$ independent observation and we want to recover the probability distribution that may have generated this dataset (or the **likelihood** of the dataset):
$$
\bm{p(D|w) = p(x_1, x_2, ...,x_N|w)} 
$$
where $\bm w$ is a set of parameters.

**Maximum Likelihood principle**:

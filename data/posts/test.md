**Artificial Intelligence** is really the shit these day.
If you don't include the words *Artificial Intelligence*, *Machine learning*, *Big Data* in your speech while pitching your newest tech product,
prepare yourself to see investors furiously yawn. But it is only the awesomeness of this technical field is to be blamed.

Ever since its conception half a decade ago, A.I has extensively transformed the face of computer science, rapidly expanding the limit of 
what these machines can do. 
Machine learning systems are capable of processing massive data and perform tasks with accuracy comparable to human. 

With the introduction of **Deep learning** around the beginning of the century along with the increasingly availability of data and computing power, 
Machine learning models can now generate, predict, perform humanlike tasks, such as **entity recognition in images**, 
**chatbots which can converse with people so naturally that some almost passed the Turing test** or **lifelike video generator (yes i am talking about Deepfake)**.

But Machine Learning isn't some kind of elite tech. For long, companies have started providing Machine Learning services for laypeople, which are really easy to 
use and incorporate into their products. The thing is, people don't really understand how those services work, and for most of the time they don't really need to, 
but you can't make best use of those techs without knowing them inside out. 

That's why AI engineers are paid so fucking much, it is a demanding and high qualified job. Most importantly, AI is deeply rooted in ***Math***.

Yes, it's a Computer Science field with papers filled with metric tons of Math symbols.

But you know what they say, you can't have life handed to you. If you want to earn figures, start getting your asses comfortable with Math. I am doing that too, really.

This blog will track my progress as I learn AI stuffs (and also English writing, I suck at it). Keep in mind that by the time I am writing these lines I am still a student.

But I am ambitious and determined to get that figures. I will learn if I have to, you'll see.
